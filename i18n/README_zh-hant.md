## 安裝

- 從 [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/ceo-py/)

    ```shell
    pip install ceo-py
    ```

- 從 [Github](https://github.com/vortezwohl/CEO/releases)

    先下載 .whl 檔案，然後執行

    ```shell
    pip install ./ceo_py-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
    ```

## 引用

如果您正在將 `CEO` 框架整合到您的研究中，請務必正確**引用**它，以聲明它對您工作的貢獻.

```latex
@software {CEO,
author = {Zihao Wu},
title = {CEO: An ultra-lightweight agentic AI framework based on the ReAct paradigm},
publisher = {Github},
howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/vortezwohl/CEO-Agentic-AI-Framework}},
year = {2024},
date = {2024-10-25}
}
```

## 快速開始

要開始構建您自己的智能體，請按照以下步驟執行。

1. 設置環境變數 `OPENAI_API_KEY`

    ```
    # .env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    ```

2. 從 `CEO` 引入 SDKs

    - `Agent` 讓您實例化一個智能體

    - `Personality` 是一個列舉類，用於自訂智能體的個性：

        - `Personality.PRUDENT` 使智能體的行為更謹慎。

        - `Personality.INQUISITIVE` 鼓勵智能體更主動嘗試和探索。

    - `get_openai_model` 給您一個 `BaseChatModel` 作為思考引擎。

    - `@ability(brain: BaseChatModel, cache: bool = True, cache_dir: str = '')` 是一個裝飾器，用來將函數聲明為一個 `Ability`.

    - `@agentic(agent: Agent)` 是一個裝飾器，用來將函數聲明為一個  `AgenticAbility`.

    ```python
    from ceo import (
        Agent,
        Personality,
        get_openai_model,
        ability,
        agentic
    )
    ```

3. 聲明函數作為基本能力

    ```python
    @ability
    def calculator(expr: str) -> float:
        # this function only accepts a single math expression
        return simplify(expr)

    @ability
    def write_file(filename: str, content: str) -> str:
        with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(content)
        return f'{content} written to {filename}.'
    ```

4. 實例化一個智能体

    您可以在實例化智能體時賦予能力。

    ```python
    model = get_openai_model()
    agent = Agent(abilities=[calculator, write_file], brain=model, name='CEO', personality=Personality.INQUISITIVE)
    ```

    - 您也可以稍後賦予更多能力給智能體：

        ```python
        agent.grant_ability(calculator)
        ```

        或

        ```python
        agent.grant_abilities([calculator])
        ```

    - 剝奪能力：

        ```python
        agent.deprive_ability(calculator)
        ```

        或

        ```python
        agent.deprive_abilities([calculator])
        ```
    
    您可以使用方法 `change_personality(personality: Personality)` 更改智能體的個性。

    ```python
    agent.change_personality(Personality.PRUDENT)
    ```

5. 指定请求給您的智能體

    ```python
    agent.assign("Here is a sphere with radius of (1 * 9.5 / 2 * 2) cm and pi here is 3.14159, find the area and volume respectively then write the results into a file called 'result.txt'.")
    ```

6. 將其餘工作交給您的智能體

    ```python
    response = agent.just_do_it()
    print(response)
    ```

> `ceo` 也支持多智能體協作場景，可用 `@agentic(agent: Agent)`, 宣告一個函數為智能體呼叫能力，然後賦予給一個智能體。[查看示例](#multi-agent)。

- ### 多智能體協作
    
    1. 請合適的智能體計算球體的表面積和體積，並將結果寫入一個文檔中。
  
        ```python
        import logging

        from sympy import simplify
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        from ceo import (
            Agent,
            Personality,
            get_openai_model,
            agentic,
            ability
        )

        load_dotenv()
        logging.getLogger('ceo').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        model = get_openai_model()


        @ability
        def calculator(expr: str) -> float:
            # this function only accepts a single math expression
            return simplify(expr)


        @ability
        def write_file(filename: str, content: str) -> str:
            with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                f.write(content)
            return f'{content} written to {filename}.'


        jack = Agent(abilities=[calculator], brain=model, name='Jack', personality=Personality.INQUISITIVE)
        tylor = Agent(abilities=[write_file], brain=model, name='Tylor', personality=Personality.PRUDENT)


        @agentic(jack)
        def agent1():
            return


        @agentic(tylor)
        def agent2():
            return


        if __name__ == '__main__':
            ceo = Agent(abilities=[agent1, agent2], brain=model, name='CEO', personality=Personality.INQUISITIVE)
            radius = '(10.01 * 10.36 * 3.33 / 2 * 16)'  # 2762.663904
            pi = 3.14159
            output_file = 'result.txt'
            request = f"Here is a sphere with radius of {radius} cm and pi here is {pi}, find the area and volume respectively then write the results into a file called '{output_file}'."
            result = ceo.assign(request).just_do_it()  # area = 95910378.2949379, volume = 88322713378.13666
            print(result)
        ```

        > 在多智能體協作的情境下，您可以為每個不同的智能體分配不同的個性。例如，在上述腳本中，Jack 的能力是進行計算。我希望他能多嘗試和探索，所以將 Jack 的個性設置為 `Personality.INQUISITIVE`. 。另一方面，Taylor 的能力是創建和寫入文檔。對於涉及與外部文檔系統交互的操作，我希望他能夠更加謹慎，所以將 Taylor 的個性設置為 `Personality.PRUDENT`.
