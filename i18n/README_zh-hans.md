## 安装

- 从 [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/ceo-py/)

    ```shell
    pip install ceo-py
    ```

- 从 [Github](https://github.com/vortezwohl/CEO/releases)

    先下载 .whl 文件，然后执行

    ```shell
    pip install ./ceo_py-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
    ```

## 引用

如果您正在将 `CEO` 框架整合到您的研究中，请务必正确**引用**它，以声明它对您工作的贡献.

```latex
@software {CEO,
author = {Zihao Wu},
title = {CEO: An ultra-lightweight agentic AI framework based on the ReAct paradigm},
publisher = {Github},
howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/vortezwohl/CEO-Agentic-AI-Framework}},
year = {2024},
date = {2024-10-25}
}
```

## 快速开始

要开始搭建您自己的智能体，请按照以下步骤执行。

1. 设置环境变量 `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`

    ```
    # .env
    DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
    ```

2. 从 `CEO` 引入 SDKs

    - `Agent` 让您实例化一个智能体。

    - `Personality` 是一个枚举类，用于设定智能体的个性：

        - `Personality.PRUDENT` 使智能体的行为更加谨慎。

        - `Personality.INQUISITIVE` 鼓励智能体更主动尝试和探索。

    - `get_deepseek_model` 给您一个 `BaseChatModel` 作为思维引擎。

    - `@ability(brain: BaseChatModel, cache: bool = True, cache_dir: str = '')` 是一个装饰器，用来将函数声明为一个 `Ability`.

    - `@agentic(agent: Agent)` 是一个装饰器，用来将函数声明为一个  `AgenticAbility`.

    ```python
    from ceo import (
        Agent,
        Personality,
        get_deepseek_model,
        ability,
        agentic
    )
    ```

3. 声明函数作为基本能力

    ```python
    @ability
    def calculator(expr: str) -> float:
        # this function only accepts a single math expression
        return simplify(expr)

    @ability
    def write_file(filename: str, content: str) -> str:
        with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(content)
        return f'{content} written to {filename}.'
    ```

4. 实例化一个智能体

    您可以在实例化智能体的时候赋予其能力。

    ```python
    model = get_deepseek_model()
    agent = Agent(abilities=[calculator, write_file], brain=model, name='CEO', personality=Personality.INQUISITIVE)
    ```

    - 您也可以稍后赋予更多能力给智能体：

        ```python
        agent.grant_ability(calculator)
        ```

        或

        ```python
        agent.grant_abilities([calculator])
        ```

    - 剥夺能力：

        ```python
        agent.deprive_ability(calculator)
        ```

        或

        ```python
        agent.deprive_abilities([calculator])
        ```
    
    您可以使用方法 `change_personality(personality: Personality)` 更改智能体的个性。

    ```python
    agent.change_personality(Personality.PRUDENT)
    ```

5. 指定请求给您的智能体

    ```python
    agent.assign("Here is a sphere with radius of (1 * 9.5 / 2 * 2) cm and pi here is 3.14159, find the area and volume respectively then write the results into a file called 'result.txt'.")
    ```

6. 将其余工作交给您的智能体

    ```python
    response = agent.just_do_it()
    print(response)
    ```

> `ceo` 也支持多智能体协作场景，可用 `@agentic(agent: Agent)`, 声明一个函数为智能体呼叫能力，然后赋予给另一个智能体。[查看示例](#multi-agent)。


## 范例

- ### 复合任务

    1. 计算一个球体的表面积和体积，然后将结果写入文件。

        ```python
        import logging

        from ceo import (
            Agent,
            Personality,

            ability
        )

        load_dotenv()

            output_file = 'result.txt'
            request = f"Here is a sphere with radius of {radius} cm and pi here is {pi}, find the area and volume respectively then write the results into a file called '{output_file}'."

            print(result)

- ### 多智能体协作
    
    1. 请合适的智能体计算球体的表面积和体积，将结果并写入文件。
  
        ```python
        import logging

        from sympy import simplify
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        from ceo import (
            Agent,
            Personality,
            get_deepseek_model,
            agentic,
            ability
        )

        load_dotenv()
        logging.getLogger('ceo').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        model = get_deepseek_model()


        @ability(model)
        def calculator(expr: str) -> float:
            # this function only accepts a single math expression
            return simplify(expr)


        @ability(model)
        def write_file(filename: str, content: str) -> str:
            with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                f.write(content)
            return f'{content} written to {filename}.'


        jack = Agent(abilities=[calculator], brain=model, name='Jack', personality=Personality.INQUISITIVE)
        tylor = Agent(abilities=[write_file], brain=model, name='Tylor', personality=Personality.PRUDENT)


        @agentic(jack)
        def agent1():
            return


        @agentic(tylor)
        def agent2():
            return


        if __name__ == '__main__':
            ceo = Agent(abilities=[agent1, agent2], brain=model, name='CEO', personality=Personality.INQUISITIVE)
            radius = '(10.01 * 10.36 * 3.33 / 2 * 16)'  # 2762.663904
            pi = 3.14159
            output_file = 'result.txt'
            request = f"Here is a sphere with radius of {radius} cm and pi here is {pi}, find the area and volume respectively then write the results into a file called '{output_file}'."
            result = ceo.assign(request).just_do_it()  # area = 95910378.2949379, volume = 88322713378.13666
            print(result)
        ```

        > 在多智能体协作场景下，您可以为不同的智能体分配不同的个性。例如，在上述脚本中，Jack 的能力是执行计算。我希望他能多尝试和探索，所以將 Jack 的个性设置为 `Personality.INQUISITIVE`。另一方面，Taylor 的能力是创建和写入文件。对于涉及外部文件系统的操作，我希望他能够更加谨慎，所以将 Taylor 的个性设置为 `Personality.PRUDENT`。
